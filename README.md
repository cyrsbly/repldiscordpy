# ReplDiscrordPY
This tool makes it **easier** for you to host your **Discord.py** bot for free using [repl.it](https://repl.it) and [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com)!

## How to get started
0. Install this package using `pip install repldiscordpy`
1. Set up a projet on [repl.it](https://repl.it)
2. Program your bot & get it to work
3. Add the following code from the *quickstart* to the top of your code!

See https://replit.com/talk/learn/Hosting-discordpy-bots-with-replit/11008 for help. But instead of their script, use mine:

## Quickstart
```py
import repldiscordpy

repldiscordpy.keep_alive()
```
